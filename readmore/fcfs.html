        First Come First Serve (FCFS) is an operating system scheduling
        algorithm that automatically executes queued requests and processes in
        order of their arrival. It is the easiest and simplest CPU scheduling
        algorithm. In this type of algorithm, processes which requests the CPU
        first get the CPU allocation first. This is managed with a FIFO queue.
        The full form of FCFS is First Come First Serve. class="hoverhide"As the
        process enters the ready queue, its PCB (Process Control Block) is
        linked with the tail of the queue and, when the CPU becomes free, it
        should be assigned to the process at the beginning of the queue.

          This method is poor in performance, and the general wait time is quite

        A real-life example of the FCFS method is buying a movie ticket on the
        ticket counter. In this scheduling algorithm, a person is served
        according to the queue manner. The person who arrives first in the queue
        first buys the ticket and then the next one. This will continue until
        the last person in the queue purchases the ticket. Using this algorithm,
        the CPU process works in a similar manner.

        <p>Here, are cons/ drawbacks of using FCFS scheduling algorithm:</p>
        <li>
          It is a Non-Preemptive CPU scheduling algorithm, so after the process
          has been allocated to the CPU, it will never release the CPU until it
          finishes executing.
        </li>
        <li>The Average Waiting Time is high.</li>
        <li>
          Short processes that are at the back of the queue have to wait for the
          long process at the front to finish.
        </li>
        <li>Not an ideal technique for time-sharing systems.</li>
        <li>Because of its simplicity, FCFS is not very efficient.</li>
